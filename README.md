# CSCI351

==> What happened here? <==
This is the material of the course. We basically copy the professor's code in class, and fill in the rest as assignment.

==> What's inside? <==
It has a player, some enemies and some obstacles. There's just 1 scene.
In fact, this can't even be called a game, since there is no winning, no purpose, no story.
All you can see is the player controls, UI and enemy AI being made.

==> How to run? <==
1. Go to #2 and run MGS.py. That's the server that connects players.
2. Go to #1 and run MAG.py.
3. When inside, create a world and explore the controls.
4. Try to run another instance of MAG.py. This supports a max of 2 players.
